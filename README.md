# DIO - Backend with Java 2024 - Project Challenge

### Challenge
The aim of this hands-on practical project is to reinforce knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java by implementing a digital bank.

#### Proposal
A bank offers its customers two types of accounts (current and savings), which have deposit, withdrawal and transfer (between the institution's own accounts) functionalities.
Considering the banking domain knowledge presented, an Object Oriented solution should be abstracted and implemented in Java.


##### Expected behaviors:
- Withdraw
- Deposit
- Transfer
